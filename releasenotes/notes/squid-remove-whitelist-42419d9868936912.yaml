    The internal Squid service is no longer used for filtering. Access to all external sources
    is possible. The existing whitelist no longer made sense because, for example, access to
    Quay or Docker Hub was completely permitted and any artifacts could then be downloaded anyway.
    If you want to filter at this level in the future, you will need an additional proxy or WAF.
